    <p>Salmorejo is a cold Spanish soup that originates from the Andalusian region. It's a refreshing and velvety blend of tomatoes, bread, olive oil, and garlic
        . Here's a basic Salmorejo recipe:</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 kg (about 2 pounds) ripe tomatoes, cored and coarsely chopped</li>
            <li>200g (about 7 ounces) day-old bread, crusts removed</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, peeled</li>
            <li>150ml (about 2/3 cup) extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sherry vinegar</li>
            <li>Salt, to taste</li>
            <li>Optional toppings: hard-boiled eggs, jamón (cured ham) or prosciutto, and a drizzle of olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak the Bread: Place the bread in a bowl and add enough water to cover it. Let it soak for about 5-10 minutes, then squeeze out excess water.</li>
            <li>Blend Ingredients: In a blender or food processor, combine the chopped tomatoes, soaked bread, peeled garlic, olive oil, and sherry vinegar. Blend until smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>Season: Taste the mixture and season with salt as needed. Adjust the acidity with more sherry vinegar if desired.</li>
            <li>Chill: Refrigerate the soup for at least 2 hours before serving to allow the flavors to meld and the soup to chill.</li>
            <li>Serve: Ladle the chilled Salmorejo into bowls. Traditionally, it is garnished with hard-boiled eggs (chopped or sliced), jamón or prosciutto, and a drizzle of olive oil.</li>
            <li>Optional: Feel free to customize the toppings based on your preferences. Some people like to add diced cucumber or green bell peppers for extra freshness.</li>
            <li>Enjoy: Serve the Salmorejo as a refreshing appetizer or light meal, especially during hot summer days.</li>
        </ol>
