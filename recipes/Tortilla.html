    <p>Tortilla de patatas, also known as Spanish omelette or Spanish tortilla, is a classic and beloved dish in Spanish cuisine. It's a simple yet satisfying dish made with eggs, potatoes, onions, and olive oil. 
        Here's a traditional recipe for making Tortilla de patatas:</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4-5 medium-sized potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 large onion, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>6 large eggs</li>
            <li>Salt, to taste</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Optional: Chopped parsley for garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare Potatoes and Onions:</strong>
                <p>Heat a generous amount of olive oil (enough to cover the bottom of the pan) in a large skillet over medium heat.</p>
                <p>Add the sliced potatoes and onions to the skillet. Cook them gently, turning occasionally, until the potatoes are tender but not browned. This can take about 10-15 minutes.
                    The key is to cook them slowly to allow the potatoes to soften.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Drain Excess Oil:</strong>
                <p>Once the potatoes and onions are cooked, use a slotted spoon to transfer them to a large bowl, allowing excess oil to drain back into the pan.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Beat the Eggs:</strong>
                <p>In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and season with salt.</p>
                </li>
            <li><strong>Combine Eggs and Potatoes:</strong>
                <p>Add the cooked potatoes and onions to the beaten eggs. Mix gently to combine, ensuring that the potatoes are well-coated with the egg mixture.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Cook the Tortilla:</strong>
                <p>Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Pour the egg and potato mixture into the skillet, spreading it evenly.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Cooking Flip:</strong>
                <p>Cook the tortilla for a few minutes, shaking the pan occasionally to prevent sticking. When the edges start to set, place a flat plate or lid over the skillet, and carefully flip the tortilla onto the plate.</p></li>
        </ol>
